title: Static is faster
permalink: "/static/"

intro: We are impatient, we’ve got things to do, and the internet is full of websites clamoring for our attention. Nothing is more frustrating than a webpage loading at a snail’s pace - in that time we could have made a tasty sandwich (or at least ordered delivery).<br><br>It’s well documented that the longer a website takes to load the more users bounce, and the less engagement they will have with the website once loaded. This is even more true for mobile users, according to Google 53% of visits are abandoned if a mobile site takes longer than three seconds to load.<br><br>A slow site can be a negative ranking factor for SEO and soon page speed with become a ranking factor on Google for mobile searches. Back in 2010 Google said 2 seconds is the threshold for e-commerce website acceptability, and Google aimed for under half a second. That was eight years ago, but it somehow still seems to be a barometer for acceptable web page load time.

- title: Why are static sites faster?
  body: Static sites are faster than greased lightning because there are no databases to sift through, no templates to generate, and no heavy lifting at all.<br><br>Web servers are primed to deliver static websites super fast, because the whole site is made of static HTML files just hanging out on the server waiting to be served, meaning once a request is sent to the server the site populates instantly.
