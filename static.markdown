title: Static is faster
permalink: "/static/"
intro: We are impatient, we’ve got things to do, and the internet is full of websites
  clamoring for our attention. Nothing is more frustrating than a webpage loading
  at a snail’s pace - in that time we could have made a tasty sandwich (or at least
  ordered delivery).<br><br>It’s <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/"
  target="_blank">well documented</a> that the longer a website takes to load the
  more users bounce, and the <a href="http://engineroom.ft.com/2016/04/04/a-faster-ft-com/"
  target="_blank">less engagement they will have with the website</a> once loaded.
  This is even more true for mobile users, according to Google <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-measurement/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/"
  target="_blank">53% of visits are abandoned if a mobile site takes longer than three
  seconds to load</a>.<br><br>A slow site can be a negative ranking factor for SEO
  and soon page speed with become a <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/01/using-page-speed-in-mobile-search.html"
  target="_blank">ranking factor on Google for mobile searches</a>. Back in 2010 Google
  said 2 seconds is the threshold for e-commerce website acceptability, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=198&v=OpMfx_Zie2g"
  target="_blank">Google aimed for under half a second</a>. That was eight years ago,
  but it somehow still seems to be a barometer for acceptable web page load time.

- title: Why are static sites faster?
  body: Static sites are faster than <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/12mg8tiWKgiRB6/giphy.gif"
    target="_blank">greased lightning</a> because there are no databases to sift through,
    no templates to generate, and no heavy lifting at all.<br><br>Web servers are
    primed to deliver static websites super fast, because the whole site is made of
    static HTML files just hanging out on the server waiting to be served, meaning
    once a request is sent to the server the site populates instantly.
- title: Speed is queen
