## We love Industry City's Food Hall. 

There is communal seating, bussing stations, and long rows of food kiosks with menus hung above the counters staffed with lovely humans who can’t wait to tell you about their bibimbap.

Each of the eateries produces its fare on-site: Inside each kiosk you can watch bakers roll croissants, butchers cure meats, and avocados smashed to perfection. Industry City’s food hall is not unlike Dekalb Food Hall or Chelsea Market but we like it best because it’s not heaving with tourists and there are plenty of food options without it feeling overwhelming.

Some of our favorites include:

**[Ends Meat](https://www.endsmeatnyc.com/) **is a whole-animal salumeria specializing in dry-cured meats sold by the pound. We can vouch for their brilliant meatball sandwiches which appear on Tuesday’s specials. They know everything there is to know about mean and also sell bones for your four legged friends.

**[Kotti Berliner Döner Kebab](http://kottidoner.com/) **makes fare that is fresh and plentiful - their wraps are substantial and their salads even have roasted potatoes in, so it’s easy to convince yourself that you made a healthy choice and still getting some sneaky carbs.

**[Ejen Korean Comfort Food](http://www.ejenfoods.com/)** is run by the sweetest couple who make killer bibimbap and our hearts melt with their cuteness.

If you’re here for maximum Instagram value, look no further than **[Avocaderia](http://www.avocaderia.com/)**, the city’s first restaurant exclusively serving avocado-centric dishes. They have an excellent neon sign and a whole new menu starring the avocado (including a burger where the bun is an avocado).
