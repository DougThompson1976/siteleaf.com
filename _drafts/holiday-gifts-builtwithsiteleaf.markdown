At Siteleaf we are behind on our Holiday shopping, so we turned to websites that use Siteleaf for some holiday inspiration and they definitely delivered. 

Here are a few things that we would love to wake up and finding in our stockings:

[**Girl‚Äôs Night In**](https://shop.girlsnightin.co) have a selection of goodies for any homebody in on your list. We love their [Going home after this keychain](https://shop.girlsnightin.co/collections/apparel/products/keychain) that lets everyone know exactly where you would rather be for just $15.

This simple typographic [2018 Wall Calendar](https://rationale-design.com/shop/sans-wall-calendar/) created by **Rationale Design** provides a beautiful and functional way for keeping track of next year‚Äôs events for $25. It‚Äôs perfect for those who appreciate order and sleek design.

Snack harder with **Aida** - you can share them at your holiday party or plough through these goodies on your sofa watching *It‚Äôs a Wonderful Life* for the 116th time, either way we won‚Äôt judge. The [full Aida set](https://www.aidaeats.com/products/the-full-set) includes lemon candied pepitas, rye and sourdough crackers, currant turmeric crisps & szechuan candied pecans for $48.

The [Hattie Ewok Backpack's](https://www.statebags.com/products/hattie-ewok) design is inspired by the Forest Moon of Endor (that‚Äôs in Star Wars for those of you who have been living light-years away). Also, the Rebel Alliance lining is üëå For $295 you‚Äôll get this great bag, and for each bag sold **State** hand-deliver a backpack packed with essential tools for success to an American child in need. Their website was designed by the great [Bondfire Inc](http://bondfireinc.com/work/state-bags-e-commerce-design-development/).

We love this [Tada Emoji Embroidered Wall Hanging](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/200433048/embroidery-tada-emoji-embroidered-4-wall?ref=shop_home_active_14\) made by the brilliant [**Jessica Harllee**](http://jessicaharllee.com) for $70. We have one featuring the üëç emoji in the Siteleaf office and it continually brightens our day.
