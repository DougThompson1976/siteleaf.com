Weâ€™re creating a new series of tutorials for Content Managers and Creators. These videos will walk you through everything you need to know about adding content to your Siteleaf site. Thereâ€™s no code involved, so you can feel confident in using Siteleaf.

Watch the first video: [exploring the Siteleaf dashboard](https://vimeo.com/258881059).

## Familiarizing yourself with Siteleaf

When you log in to your account youâ€™ll see something like this.

This is the Siteleaf Dashboard. The first thing youâ€™ll notice is the sidebar. Here the elements of your website broken down into four sections.

**Content**

The Content section is organized by collectionsâ€”think of these as your main content buckets.

This site has several collections, but you may only have a few options on yours. It depends on how your site has been set up. When looking at a new website I always click on each collection to familiarise myself with the content, and then look at the published website to see how they relate.

A Page is the most basic content type in Siteleaf - these might include your â€˜Aboutâ€™ page or a â€˜Contactâ€™ page.

As a content creator youâ€™re most likely to want to know about the blog. Posts are connected to the blog page on your website. If your site does not have a blog, then feel free to ignore this section.

You can click on the title of the post to edit. When you click through to the post youâ€™ll see up at the top is the title, you can click on it to edit it. Underneath is the postâ€™s URL, and you can change the slug by clicking on the pencil icon. A slug is the editable part of your postâ€™s URL.

Here is the URL of the post:

> https://www.siteleaf.com/blog/seo-with-jekyll-siteleaf/

This part is the `slug`:

> /seo-with-jekyll-siteleaf/

Having slugs that are readable by both humans and machines is useful for SEO. Readable slugs encourage users to click on the link, because they already understand what the post is about. Also, you are signposting your post to the web crawlers so they too can understand what your post is about. For more tips on SEO read our [blog post about SEO with Jekyll and Siteleaf](https://www.siteleaf.com/blog/seo-with-jekyll-siteleaf/).

Underneath is all the main body content of the page. You may also see inputs for metadata beneath the main body content, these will vary depending on how your site is set up. Weâ€™ll go through metadata, tags, post visibility and more in our dedicated blog post video.
