The old saying "Cash is King" is a classic in the finance world.

Similarly, in the computer world, the basics for most modern computers involved text files - Especially Unix / Linux which most of the web is built on.

One of the key weaknesses of Microsoft Windows in  general and Microsoft Office files (like Word or Excel) is that they are binary files - i.e. just 1's and 0's.

So the simplest way to fix this is to save everything to a text file, including the data and cell formulas.
